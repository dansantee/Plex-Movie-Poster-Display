This is a summary of the information contained in the original blog, with my own notes, in the case that it should become unavailable. I don't think  it's complete, so I'll update it if I need to reload in the future.

PMDP scrapes http://IP_ADDRESS_OF_PLEX_SERVER>:32400/status/sessions and displays the poster, current progress, and description of the currently playing movie or TV show on a screen. If the client is not playing any media the script shows random movie posters from the Plex Server.

Install a Raspberry Pi image. I'm using Bullseye on an RPi 3b for compatibility reasons. I've added a fade feature to the poster which makes a 3b the minimum I'd recommend.

Enable wireless and SSH if desired.

Install Required software packages

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install nginx php-fpm php-xml php-curl git unclutter -y

Setup PHP with NGINX

Update: Remove index.nginx-debian.html from config. Sometimes when Nginx is upgraded it would load the default index.nginx-debian.html Nginx file (not the index.php file we want to load).

Add index.php to index line (Around line 44)
Before:
index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html
After:
index index.html index.htm index.php;

cd /etc/nginx
sudo nano sites-enabled/default
index index.html index.htm index.php;

Scroll Down, uncomment the following lines, and save the file.

location ~ \.php$ {
  include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
  fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.3-fpm.sock;
}
Save Changes.

Increase NGINX File Size Limitation
By default NGINX limits the file size you can upload (I think it defaults to 1MB). I recommend increasing the allowed file size so you can upload larger custom images.

sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

- Add the follow in the http section after types_hash_max_size 2048;
client_max_body_size 25M;

- Save Changes.
CTRL + O to write changes
CTRL + X to exit
Increase PHP upload_max_filesize.
sudo nano /etc/php/7.3/fpm/php.ini

- Change upload_max_filesize (Around line 845)
upload_max_filesize = 25M

- Save File
- Reboot Raspberry Pi (Might not need to reboot, but I had to for change to work).
Setup PHP information file.
cd /var/www/html/
sudo mv index.nginx-debian.html index.php
sudo nano index.php
  - Add <?php echo phpinfo(); ?> to top of file.
  - Save Changes.
CTRL + O to write changes
CTRL + X to exit
Restart / Start NGINX and Test
sudo /etc/init.d/nginx reload
Opening a browser to http://<ip_address_of_your_raspberry_pi> . If everything is installed correctly. you should see the php information screen.

Clone Dev Branch (Future v3)
cd /your_preferred_git_directory
sudo git clone --branch dev https://github.com/MattsShack/Plex-Movie-Poster-Display.git
cd Plex-Movie-Poster-Display
sudo cp -R * /var/www/html
  - You can replace index.php used for in the testing above.
Fix Permissions
sudo chmod -R 774 /var/www/html/
sudo chown -R pi:www-data /var/www/html/

First Time Use
Open Browser to http://<ip_of_raspberry_pi>/settings/login.php and login with username admin and password password1 .

Once logged into the admin page, you will need to update the Plex Server IP, Plex Token, and Plex Movie Sections in “Server Configuration” before PMDP will work properly.

Important: The Movie Sections input is expecting the ID (#) of the Plex library you want PMPD to use for posters. You can add multiple sections as long as they are comma separated and contain no spaces.

How to find your Plex sections ID(s):
Open your Plex web interface via the browser of your choice.
Select the desired section(s) from menu on the left. (Example: Movies)
Once the section is loaded… Look towards the end of the URL in the browser. You should see something like “source=2”.

Misc Raspberry Pi OS Steps
Full Buster / Raspberry OS Upgrade:

sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade
sudo reboot
Disable Screen Blanking: 

Click on the Raspberry Pi (Menu) icon. Select Preferences, Raspberry Pi Configuration, and then the Display tab. Choose Disable next to Screen Blanking.

Enable SSH:

Click on the Raspberry Pi (Menu) icon. Select Preferences, Raspberry Pi Configuration, and then the Interfaces tab. Choose Enable next to SSH.

Rotate Screen:

Click on the Raspberry Pi (Menu) icon. Select Preferences, and Screen Configuration. Right click on the screen you want to rotate and select orientation.

Chromium Kiosk Mode on Startup
Raspbian Buster / Raspberry OS: 

With Raspbian Buster / Raspberry OS I was not able to use the .desktop file method to auto start Chromium. Instead I had to create a directory and file. I am not sure if this method needs unclutter installed so I left it in the instructions.

sudo nano /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart

- Add the following 
/usr/bin/chromium-browser --kiosk  --disable-restore-session-state http://[PMPD IP Address]/index.php

-Save File
CTRL + O to write changes
CTRL + X to exit

-Reboot to Test

This is the end of the blog steps. I had to change a few things for my installation, including how the kiosk mode worked and force enable HDMI.
